                    The Philippine Eagle is arguably the largest eagle in the
                    world. It is only found in the Philippines, and is declared
                    as the country's national bird. In Tagalog, it is called
                    "Haribon" which translates to "King of Birds".
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    The Philippine Eagle has a big cultural and symbolic
                    importance to the Philippines. It plays a crucial role in
                    their environment by keeping the balance of the ecosystem.
                    Conserving them and their habitats will automatically
                    provide an umbrella protection to all other lifeforms in its
                    territory.

                            of wingspan- that is about 7 feet or 2 meters! The
                            males weigh up to 4.8kg, while females can weigh up
                            to 6.8kg.

                            clearer and farther than human eyes. Also, it is the
                            only eagle with blue-grey eyes.

                            riveting, powerful. They’re magnificent, they’re
