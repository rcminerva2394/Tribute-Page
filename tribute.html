      <p> The Philippine Eagle is arguably the largest eagle in the world. It is only found in the Philippines, and is declared as the country's national bird. In Tagalog, it is called "Haribon" which translates to "King of Birds". </p><br>
      <p> The Philippine Eagle has a big cultural and symbolic importance to the Philippines. It plays a crucial role in their environment by keeping the balance of the ecosystem. Conserving them and their habitats will automatically provide an umbrella protection to all other lifeforms in its territory. </p>

        <p>"When a Philippine Eagle looks right in your eye and makes eye contact it’s breathtaking. The crest flares up, those light eyes, those beautiful bluish eyes stare right at your eyes and that contact is riveting, powerful. They’re magnificent, they’re splendid, you know. It’s truly, truly a unique creature."</p>
